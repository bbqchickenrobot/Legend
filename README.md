Legend
=============

Legend is a work in progree multi-user text adventure game.

Tech
----

The bulk of the engine is driven by SignalR & RavenDB.  Some javascript and 
jquery to drive the interface, but not much.  Hey, it's just text!

Theme & Direction
-----------------

Every player takes the role of a fledgling magician that is trying to increase 
in knowledge and power in order to confront an evil wizard that has taken over 
the town.

Magicians advance in level by doing odd little things throughout the world.

There will be some player interaction.  This interaction is completely up to 
the players.  Will they help or hinder their fellow man?

Currently there isn't much of a world.  It's a temporary constuct while 
the engine is being built.
